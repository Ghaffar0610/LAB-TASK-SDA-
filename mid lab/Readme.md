Transport System - Java Implementation
This project is a simple Transport Management System implemented in Java using the following principles:

Observer Pattern: To handle notifications whenever a transport record is saved.
Layered Architecture: Separating the application into Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Layers for modularity.
Pipe-and-Filter Architecture: Sequentially processing user inputs, business logic, and data storage.
Features
Transport Types:
Public Transport: Pay on the spot.
Own Convenience: Flexible schedules and "Pay as you use."
University Transport: Advance payment with timing restrictions.
Observer Pattern:
Notify observers (e.g., NotificationLogger) whenever a transport record is saved.
Layered Architecture:
Clear separation of input, processing, and storage logic.
Extensible Design:
Easily add new transport types or notification mechanisms.
How It Works
User Input:
The user selects a transport type (e.g., Public Transport, Own Convenience).
Processing:
The system processes the input and prepares an appropriate message based on the transport type.
Storage and Notification:
The processed record is saved in the storage layer.
Observers are notified about the saved record.
Logging:
The logger observer logs the notification details.
Technologies Used
Java: Programming language.
Design Patterns: Observer Pattern, Layered Architecture.
OOP Principles: Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Modularity.
Project Architecture
The project follows a three-layered architecture:

Presentation Layer:
Class: TransportInput
Handles user input collection.
Business Logic Layer:
Class: TransportProcessor
Processes input and prepares results.
Data Layer:
Class: TransportStorage, TransportSubject, NotificationLogger
Stores transport data and handles notifications using the observer

# **Transport System in Java**

This project implements a **Transport Management System** using **Observer Pattern**, **Layered Architecture**, and **Pipe-and-Filter Design**. The system allows users to manage transport types while providing modular and maintainable code.

---

## **Key Features**

1. **Observer Pattern**: 
   - Used for notifying observers whenever a transport record is saved.
   - Example: A logger observes and logs transport system updates.

2. **Three-Layered Architecture**:
   - **Presentation Layer**: Handles user input.
   - **Business Logic Layer**: Processes user input and applies rules.
   - **Data Layer**: Stores the transport records and triggers notifications.

3. **Pipe-and-Filter Design**:
   - Sequential processing from input to storage.

4. **Transport Types**:
   - Public Transport: Pay on the spot.
   - Own Convenience: Flexible schedule with "pay-as-you-use."
   - University Transport: Advance payment with timing restrictions.

---

## **Code Overview**

### **Class Diagram**
The project uses the following key classes:
- **TransportInput**: Collects user input.
- **TransportProcessor**: Processes the input.
- **TransportStorage**: Saves transport records.
- **TransportSubject**: Manages the observers.
- **Observer Interface**: Defines a contract for observers.
- **NotificationLogger**: A concrete observer to log notifications.

### **How Observer Pattern Works**

- `TransportSubject` maintains a list of observers.
- Whenever a record is saved, the `notifyObservers()` method is called.
- The `NotificationLogger` (an observer) is notified to log the event.

---

## **Code Snippets**

### **Observer Pattern**
The **Observer Pattern** is used to handle notifications:
```java
public interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

public class NotificationLogger implements Observer {
    @Override
    public void update(String message) {
        System.out.println("Logger: " + message);
    }
}

public class TransportSubject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void attach(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers(String message) {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(message);
        }
    }
}
Layered Architecture
1. Presentation Layer
Handles user input:


public class TransportInput {
    public String getInput() {
        return "Public Transport";
    }
}
2. Business Logic Layer
Processes user input:


public class TransportProcessor {
    public String process(String transportType) {
        if (transportType.equals("Public Transport")) {
            return "Pay on the spot.";
        } else if (transportType.equals("Own Convenience")) {
            return "Flexible schedule. Pay as you use.";
        } else {
            return "Advance payment. Timing restrictions apply.";
        }
    }
}
3. Data Layer
Saves records and triggers notifications:


public class TransportStorage {
    private List<String> records = new ArrayList<>();
    private TransportSubject subject;

    public TransportStorage(TransportSubject subject) {
        this.subject = subject;
    }

    public void save(String record) {
        records.add(record);
        subject.notifyObservers("New transport record saved: " + record);
    }
}
Execution Flow
Input:
The user provides the transport type.
Processing:
The input is processed based on transport rules.
Storage and Notification:
Processed data is saved.
The TransportSubject notifies all observers.
Logging:
The NotificationLogger logs the details.
