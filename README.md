# Social Networking Application

## Overview

This is a simple social networking application that allows users to create profiles, sign up with email, and store their information. The application is built in Java, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. It includes a user registration system where the user details are stored in memory, with basic validation on user input.

## Features

- **Create User Profiles**: Users can create their profiles by entering their name, email, and password.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the email is unique and doesn't already exist in the system.
- **Simple UI**: A graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.
- **MVC Architecture**: Organized code into layers such as Application Layer, Domain Layer, Infrastructure Layer, and UI Architecture.

## Technologies Used

- Java (Core)
- Java Swing for GUI (User Interface)
- HashMap for data storage
